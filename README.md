# LED-Frequence-V2

Me and my friends were curious about MOSFETs and what they can do and decided after performing various LED labs to do a circuit that would enable us to create sound-responsive LED circuit. We scoured the internet and found the datasheet for the LED strip and then saw a website for the CMOS Quad Filter. This is all done through the Arduino microcontroller. We were forced to use the Arduino UNO due to the LED strip requiring about 12 volts.
